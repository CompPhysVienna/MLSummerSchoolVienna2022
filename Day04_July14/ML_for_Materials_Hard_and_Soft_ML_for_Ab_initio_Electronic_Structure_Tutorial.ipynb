        "Where JAX starts to diverge from NumPy is in its various _program transformations_. These are decorators which can be added to JAX functions which change how they behave. One of the most useful for getting good performance is `jax.jit` - JIT being short for \"just-in-time\", a type of compilation that happens _as a program is being executed_, rather than before execution (in fact JAX stands for \"Just After eXecution\", reflecting its particular compilation strategy).\n",
        "\n",
        "A function decorated with `jax.jit` will execute normally as interpreted Python the first time it is run, but as it is being run, the JAX compiler traces the function into a domain-specific language called a \"jaxpr\" (short for _JAX Expression_) which can then be handed off to the compiler for XLA, the backend used by JAX. This compiled function can then be executed efficiently (sometimes much more efficiently) on any hardware that supports XLA. Compilation is sometimes slow the first time a function is executed, but the compiled code is fast thereafter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The compiled code assumes a _fixed input size_ - if a new input of a different size is provided to the function, compilation is triggered again. The compiler also assumes a _fixed computation graph_ - if the code being compiled has any control statments like `if`, `for` or `while`, it will assume that the particular branch followed during execution is _always_ followed. If that is not the desired behavior, then there are special control statements for JAX such as `jax.lax.cond` for conditionals and `jax.lax.while_loop` for while loops. Using these can also speed up compilation and reduce the memory requirements, but they are outside the scope of this tutorial."

However, JAX is clever enough that it can automatically convert a `custom_jvp` rule into a `custom_vjp` rule, meaning that custom reverse-mode gradients can be obtained _for free_ given forward-mode gradients.

        "One last wrinkle with JAX. You may have noticed that whenever we needed a random number, we used NumPy rather than JAX. That's because JAX's statelessness applies to random number generators as well. To make execution as deterministic as possible, JAX makes the random number generator state explicit, meaning you have to manage the random number state if you require a source of randomness inside a compiled JAX function. Often it is enough to simply have the random numbers generated outside JAX functions and passed in, but in other cases that might be too slow, as it can involve sending large amounts of data between devices and host."
